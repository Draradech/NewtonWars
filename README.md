NewtonWars
==========

NewtonWars is a space battle game. Gravity is the main theme, influencing the path of your missiles around numerous planets on the battlefield.

It is heavily inspired by [Gravitational Combat](http://home.cs.tum.edu/~jain/software/gravcombat.php).

The game is played with the display on a TV or projector and each participant connected via telnet (with a laptop or smartphone). 

Hint: NewtonWars assumes vsync is enabled. If it is running way too fast on your system, you can use the throttle argument to slow it down (set to 16 for example).
