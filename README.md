NewtonWars
==========

NewtonWars is a space battle game. Gravity is the main theme, influencing the path of your missiles around numerous planets on the battlefield.

It is heavily inspired by [Gravitational Combat](http://home.cs.tum.edu/~jain/software/gravcombat.php).

The game is best played in "party mode" with the display on a TV or projector and each participant connected via telnet (with a laptop or smartphone). Other possible modes (e.g. local hot-seat multiplayer) are currently not implemented, but may be added later.
